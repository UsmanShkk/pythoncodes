# Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains solutions to various programming problems and coding challenges, with a primary focus on problem-solving techniques using Python. It is designed to help you practice and improve your skills in algorithmic thinking, data structures.

## Repository Structure

- **/problems/** - Contains individual problem solutions, each in its dedicated folder.
- **/data_structures/** - Implementations of common data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, linked lists).
- **/algorithms/** - A library of algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, recursion) that are often used to solve the problems.
- **/utilities/** - Helper functions or modules that assist in solving problems or running tests.
- **README.md** - Overview of the repository, including instructions for setup and contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of Python and algorithms

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/problem-solving.git
    cd problem-solving
    ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install any necessary packages (if required):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running Solutions

Each solution is typically a standalone script. To run a solution for a specific problem, navigate to its folder and execute it with Python:

```bash
python problems/problem_name.py
```

For test cases or scripts with multiple functions, run the file in an IDE or add test cases at the end of the script.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can submit new solutions, optimize existing ones, or add new problems and test cases.
